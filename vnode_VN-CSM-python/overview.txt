What's left to do primary:
send and recv packets pass off to VNode (vnode.py) class
getState, getStateSize, and saveState ports
what should timers be set for at the beginning? can't find initial values in C++ CSM code.
other initial values from Tcl not found

What's left to do secondary:
rand() seeding - not necessary?
common packet header - not actually used by anything anymore
ip header - not actually used by anything anymore
